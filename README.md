This is the project called Expense Tracker App where User can go and insert his or her incomes and expenses and the app help him or her to track his or her expenses and income.

I used Node JS to create connection to the database and different modules like "Bcrypjs" for hashing the password, express, body-parser, dotenv, and mysql2.

User can be able to Insert His or Her yearly income and then insert his or her daily, monthly or yearly income and then the App will help him or her to calculate the left balance.

User can also retrieve his or her expenses by using user_id.

This application run on server on port 5500, first you run the server by writing "node server.js" in terminal or git bash. once you do it, you will get successfully messages in your terminal.

To run it in browser, you may write "172.0.0.1:5500" this will get you to the home page where you can also be able to navigate to the "View Expenses" page.

To get to the "Register" and "Login" page you can just write "172.0.0.1:5500/register.html" here you will be able to get to the register page and also you can navigate to login page.

This application is also still in development because I want to add more features in order to make it more helpful and interactive.
